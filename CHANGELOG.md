# Changelog

## Build 111

- Switch and PS5: the main menu has no QUIT: the console's own Home or PS button leaves the game. (thelinkin3000)
- PS5: each build has its own version number on the console, so stores and the console can tell that a newer build is an update. (thelinkin3000)

## Build 110

- Switch and Android: Halo's loading screen draws, the light sweeping over the Xbox's picture with its glowing trail; maps extracted by earlier builds get the picture from the disc image at the next start (on every platform). (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: the first seconds after starting no longer freeze or cut the music, and the menus appear whole once their shaders are ready, behind the loading screen. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: when it looks for an update, the Switch also downloads the shaders of the campaign and of every multiplayer map (the shared shader keys), so a console compiles them in the background from its first start instead of as each map is first played. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: a map's load waits for its shaders under the loading screen, ten seconds at most, so a level's first moments are drawn whole; the loading screen's light now sweeps across the whole wait. Going back to the menus after a level no longer waits four seconds. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch, Android and PS5: maps load sooner: the map is read from the card while it is unpacked (a campaign level about two seconds sooner on the Switch). (thelinkin3000)
- Android and PS5: no more objects missing for the first frames of a map or a new effect: shaders compile on all the cores but two, and a draw whose shader is not ready compiles it itself, for up to a frame's time each frame. (thelinkin3000)

## Build 109

- Switch: fixes a freeze in The Library's opening cutscene, and pauses of a few seconds while loading: a part of a frame the game waited for was never sent to the GPU. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: no more drops to 25 frames a second where The Library's Sentinels fire their beams behind the crystal: the game waited for the GPU in the middle of each frame. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: steady 60 frames a second. Frames were started in bursts and then held back, which dropped frames even with the CPU and GPU at 40%; each frame now starts one refresh after the last. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: no more hitch the first time a high-res HUD element shows (the damage arrows, the meters, the scopes): the console decodes them as the map loads. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: Dynamic Resolution in Video Setup drops one step while the GPU falls behind; Resolution Limit is 720 by default; fewer large particles at once and a cheaper zoom keep heavy scenes at 60. (thelinkin3000)
- Android: Maximum Resolution in Video Setup, the screen's own by default, down to 480; Vulkan draws cost less; the restart notice in Video Setup no longer covers FOV and Viewmodels. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch and Android: the high-res button prompts draw. (thelinkin3000)

## Build 106

- PS5: fixes a bug with the updater. It installed a new release's files
  without the permission to run them, so the game did not start again
  after an update; it now installs them as FTP does. Build 105's updater
  still has the bug: on Build 105, install this build by hand, once: over
  FTP, delete the PPSA99500 folder in /data/homebrew, then copy this
  build's in its place (copying over the old files keeps the ones an
  update wrote unable to run). Your saves and settings, in /data/halo,
  stay. Updates after it install themselves. (thelinkin3000)
- The README opens with a trailer: the game on the Nintendo Switch
  (puginatux's video).

## Build 105

- PS5: the game as a homebrew title for a jailbroken PS5 (system software
  13.60 or lower, with ShadowMountPlus and an FTP server):
  halo-ps5-release.zip, whose PPSA99500 folder goes in /data/homebrew and
  the disc image in /data/halo. Up to native 4K at 120 frames a second on
  a TV that takes it, split screen with a second pad, aiming with the
  DualSense's gyroscope, voice chat through the pad's microphone, and
  system link and internet play with every other build. It draws with the
  Android port's Vulkan renderer on RADV, and updates itself from the
  releases while you play. The first visit to each place on a new install
  can stutter while its shaders are made. (thelinkin3000)

## Build 104

- Switch and Android (Vulkan): Custom Edition maps and mods draw their
  armor, visors and HUD meters as on PC. Halo PC keeps a multipurpose
  map's masks in other channels than the Xbox, and these renderers read
  them in the Xbox's order: a modded cyborg's visor did not reflect, and
  team colors and glow came out wrong. (thelinkin3000)
- From OpenCE: a text chat for network games: T to everyone and Y to the
  team on a keyboard, D-pad Up opens an on-screen keyboard for a
  controller, Tab sends to everyone, the team or the vehicle; the host can
  turn it off and mute players, players can mute one another from the
  scoreboard, and Network Setup's new MULTIPLAYER HUD page holds its
  settings (Jonas Volman, MrBruh). Streamer mode, on Network Setup's
  STREAMER MODE page, hides slurs, swearing and insults in other players'
  names and text, and in maps and mods (MrBruh). A host shares maps at up
  to 20 MB/s, and a player helping it at up to 10 MB/s (MrBruh).

## Build 103

- A level no longer shows a frame of itself before its intro's fade and
  cinematic: with interpolation, no frame of a map is drawn before its
  first tick. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: a level started in the first seconds after launch waits under
  the loading screen for its shaders, as later ones do, instead of starting
  with draws missing for a second or two (the intro's fade and letterbox
  bars among them). (thelinkin3000)
- From OpenCE: mods can replace a map's models whose nodes, markers and
  regions match (MrBruh); Audio Setup's new SOUND PROCESSING screen holds
  Reverb and the resampler, SINC (the default) or LINEAR, which is brighter
  (audio.resampler), and turning reverb off no longer muffles every sound
  (WhiteBulL, MrBruh).

## Build 102

- Switch: the game's GPU commands are handed to the GPU on a thread of
  their own, so the game goes on with the next frame meanwhile; a full
  40-player match ran without a fault. debug.render_thread in config.toml
  turns it off. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: cutscene blurs (Pillar of Autumn, Two Betrayals) are drawn on a
  small copy of the screen, as the zoom's are: from 18-39 ms of the GPU's
  frame to about 2.6 ms. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: dynamic lights (the flashlight, explosions, plasma) are drawn
  only within their reach, and object shadows only within their box on
  the screen: shadows cost about half as much, lights about a tenth less.
  (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: transparent draws (particles, decals, glass) skip the pixels
  their blend leaves as they were. (thelinkin3000)
- Object shadows are limited to the largest 16 on screen
  (display.shadow_limit), the others fading out, for crowded games.
  (thelinkin3000)
- Crowded games spend less time on bodies settling onto the ground: their
  collision tests pass by objects they cannot hit before looking them up.
  (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: draws given a vertex at a time send only what each vertex sets:
  a decal's vertices are a fifth of the data they were. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: 900p is a choice of Video Setup's resolution. (thelinkin3000)
- New Game starts the level from its beginning, not from the profile's
  last checkpoint. (thelinkin3000)
- Settings > Gameplay: how players' and the AI's bodies fall (the death
  animations, or a ragdoll), and the main menu's background keeps playing
  on the settings screens. (WataNoge)
- Settings > Gameplay > Terminal output: the game's messages at the bottom
  left are shown in the main menu only by default, or never, or always
  (game.terminal_output). (thelinkin3000)
- From OpenCE: client-side mods, with a Mods menu, load order and checks
  for mods that cannot be played together (MrBruh); the complete
  high-resolution Xbox HUD, with Classic, Gems and Menu Gems button
  styles, the pause menu's artwork and timer digits restored, and HUD and
  text settings applied without reloading the map (chestahh); a vehicle
  nobody drives follows the host's positions, and screen fog stays on the
  canopy at a wider field of view (justinfilip); voice chat drops damaged
  packets (Paul Hontz).

Thanks to puginatux for testing the performance work so thoroughly: the
profiles of cutscenes, flashlights, snow, explosions and crowded matches
they recorded showed where each of these improvements was needed, and
proved each one.

Network version 29

## Build 101

- Switch: the maps the game plays are kept unpacked in memory instead of
  in cache files on the SD card: maps load in a second or two, the game no
  longer writes some 730 MB of cache files to the card, or a map to it each
  time a cache file takes a new one, and the old cache files are deleted.
  (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: zooming in keeps the middle of the view sharp, where you aim; the
  blur stays at the edges. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: gyroscope aiming turns 50% further at every sensitivity.
  (thelinkin3000)

Network version 29

## Build 100

- Switch: zooming in costs about 3.7 ms less of the GPU's frame at 720p:
  the zoom's blur is drawn on a small copy of the screen and blended over
  it once, with the same look. debug.original_zoom in config.toml draws it
  as before. (thelinkin3000)

Network version 29

## Build 99

- Switch: crowded games no longer freeze the picture with a GPU fault.
  deko3d wrote a few words past the end of a piece of command memory, and
  the next command overwrote them before the GPU read them. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: the level is drawn about a quarter faster: the pixel shaders
  leave out the clamps their values cannot need, with the same picture.
  (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: shadows cast on the level cost about half as much on the GPU,
  each one shaded only over its own map. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: drawing into a render target waits for the GPU only when that
  target was sampled, not after every shadow. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: the shader cache drops the shaders of earlier versions, which
  could fill it and leave the game drawing nothing. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: GPU diagnostics for bug reports, all off unless set in
  config.toml's [debug]: gpu_trace (the last commands before a GPU fault),
  gpu_profile and gpu_capture (where the GPU's time goes). (thelinkin3000)

Network version 29

## Build 97

- Custom Edition maps keep their own names; a game names its map's
  version, which a client finds its copy by, and maps an earlier build
  renamed get their names back. A download beside another version of its
  name is listed as "(2)". (MrBruh)
- Map sharing and Custom Edition map loading are hardened against damaged
  or hostile files. (MrBruh)
- custom_maps subfolders work with the above: a client in a network game
  finds its copy of the game's map in a subfolder too. (thelinkin3000)

Network version 29

## Build 96

- Switch: the program's main thread sleeps instead of spinning on the
  game's core, which kept the CPU busy for nothing. (nx-mod)
- Network games catch up at most 4 ticks a frame, so one slow frame no
  longer snowballs into frames of several seconds. (nx-mod)

Network version 28

## Build 95

- Switch: a GPU fault no longer ends the game; it is logged and the
  picture stops. (thelinkin3000)
- Android and Switch: text that starts with an underscore keeps it, so
  shared Custom Edition maps are named once, not again at every start.
  (thelinkin3000)
- A config.toml line that cannot be read is set aside, instead of every
  setting going back to its default. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: CPU clock in Video Setup, Performance: 1.7 GHz (default), 1 GHz
  or stock. (thelinkin3000)
- Switch: Resolution Limit in Video Setup: 480p (default), 720p or 1080p,
  shown at 720p in handheld and 1080p docked. (thelinkin3000)

Network version 28

## Build 94

- Bodies in multiplayer fall as ragdolls: game.ragdoll "woody" (default),
  "halo2" or "none". A host keeps stock body physics, so it plays with
  builds without ragdolls. (thelinkin3000)
- Gyro aim on the Switch's controllers, in a profile's Gamepads, Gyro Aim.
  (WataNoge)
- Gyro aim ONLY ON ZOOM, and the phone's gyroscope set in Gyro Aim on
  Android. (thelinkin3000)
- custom_maps subfolders, listed under singleplayer or multiplayer.
  (WataNoge)
- Split screen on the Switch: each view's map, clears and pause menu drawn
  correctly. (WataNoge, thelinkin3000)
- A lobby with everyone on one machine starts, and START NOW works.
  (WataNoge)
- Switch settings are saved to the SD card when the game exits. (WataNoge)
- Fixes to profile editing in the pause menu and Back after a game.
  (WataNoge)
